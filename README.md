# Bank_analysis
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the performance of the largest nine commercial banks in Rwanda. Using financial metrics such as the CAMEL analysis and key performance indicators, I evaluated their profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and market position. The report highlights trends in the banking sector, identifies challenges, and provides insights into the factors driving growth and stability in Rwanda's financial landscape. This analysis reflects my expertise in financial modeling, data analysis, and industry research.
